***How to do it?***: 

- Open the Rmarkdown file of this assignment ([link](fa2021_assignment12.Rmd)) in Rstudio. 

- Right under each **question**, insert  a code chunk (you can use the hotkey `Ctrl + Alt + I` to add a code chunk) and code the solution for the question. 

- `Knit` the rmarkdown file (hotkey: `Ctrl + Alt + K`) to export an html.  

-  Publish the html file to your Githiub Page. 

***Submission***: Submit the link on Github of the assignment to Blackboard.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)
```


-------

1. Install the package `mlbench` and use the follows to import the data

```{r}
library(mlbench)
data(PimaIndiansDiabetes)
df <- PimaIndiansDiabetes
```

- Set seed to be 2020. 
- The target variable is `diabetes`
- Partition the data into 80% training and 20% testing.  
```{r}
library(mlbench)
library(caret)
library(rpart)
data(PimaIndiansDiabetes)
df <- PimaIndiansDiabetes

set.seed(2020)

names(df)[9] <- 'target'

df$target <- factor(df$target)

df$age[is.na(df$age)] = mean(df$age, na.rm = TRUE)

splitIndex <- createDataPartition(df$target, p = .80, list = FALSE)
df_train <-  df[ splitIndex,]
df_test <- df[ -splitIndex,]
```

2. Use cross-validation of 30 folds to tune random forest (method='rf').  What is the `mtry` value that produces the greatest accuracy?
 
-------

3. Use cross-validation with of 30 folds to tune random forest (method='ranger').  What are the parameters that produce the greatest accuracy?

-------

4. Go to https://topepo.github.io/caret/available-models.html and pick a classification model.  Tune the classification model using cross-validation of 30 folds. 

-------

5. Pick three models at [this link](https://topepo.github.io/caret/available-models.html) to compare using 15-fold cross validation method. Evaluate the accuracy of the final model on the test data. What is the best model?

6. Redo Question 5 on this following dataset. 

 - `Adult Census Income` dataset ([Link](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/adult-census-income)) where the target variable is `income`
 -  `Credit card default` dataset ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset)) where the target variable is `default.payment.next.month`
