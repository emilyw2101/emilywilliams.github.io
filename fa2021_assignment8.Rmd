***How to do it?***: 

- Open the Rmarkdown file of this assignment ([link](fa2021_assignment8.Rmd)) in Rstudio. 

- Right under each **question**, insert  a code chunk (you can use the hotkey `Ctrl + Alt + I` to add a code chunk) and code the solution for the question. 

- `Knit` the rmarkdown file (hotkey: `Ctrl + Alt + K`) to export an html.  

-  Publish the html file to your Githiub Page. 

***Submission***: Submit the link on Github of the assignment to Canvas

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)
```


-------

1. Install two packages `gganimate` and `gifski` then restart Rstudio. Use the WHO's dataset at [this link](https://covid19.who.int/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv). Make a top-10 bar race by months between countries on the number of deaths by Covid 19.  
```{r}
df <- read.csv('https://covid19.who.int/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv')
```

2. Make another bar race using that dataset.  
```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(gganimate)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(knitr)
```



3. Make a bar race using a dataset of your own interest. You may use the dataset that we use in class (https://covidtracking.com/data/download/all-states-history.csv) but you should make a different bar racev from ones in the slides.
